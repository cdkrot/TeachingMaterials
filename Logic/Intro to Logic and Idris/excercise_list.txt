Mathematical exercises:

* Prove lemma of deduction

Programming exercises:

* Prove (min a (max a b) = a)

* Prove (a : Nat) -> (b : Nat) -> (S a = S b) -> (a = b)

* Define mult

* (Possibly hard) prove multiplication properties:

mult(a, b) = mult(b, a)
mult(a, plus(b, c)) = plus(mult(a, b), mult(a, c))

* Formalize and prove that if b divides by a, then b divides a+b
Hint: some formalizations are easier to work with others!

* Formalize 'a <= b' statement (it should be a Type), prove:
* a <= b -> a + c <= b + c
* a <= b, c <= d -> a*c <= b * d
* a <= b, b <= a -> a = b

* (Hard) Prove disjoint : (Zero = Succ n) -> Void
(Use Builtin.replace : (x = y) -> (p x) -> p y, with p defined as Nat->Type)

* Define a binary tree and insert(x) operation
* (Hard) Prove that (depth (insert tree x) <= 1 + (depth $ insert tree x)
